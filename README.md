Overview of the Analysis

Hewlett Packard is facing a 'silver tsunami', a massive amount of employees retiring in a short amount of time.
To manage the impact of the retirements coming up, Hewlett Packard is creating a mentorship program to allow for continuity
after the retiring employees retire. We were tasked with determining who is retiring, what titles and departments the retiring
employees have. We were tasked with determining those employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. The information
gathered will be used to see where the most attention should be put.

Results

- There are 1,550 employees eligible for the mentorship program
- The titles of retiring employees are overwhelmingly senior positions
- Two managers are retiring
- The majority of those retiring are Senior Enineers and Senior Staff

Summary

A striking point in our data is that the average employee age is 63.9 and there are no employees younger than 50.
It is clear that there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor
the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. There will need to be an aditional strategy to manage the 
silver tsunami.
